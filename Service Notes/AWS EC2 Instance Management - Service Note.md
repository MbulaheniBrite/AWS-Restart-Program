## 🎯 What This Lab Was All About

This lab gave me a solid introduction to launching, resizing, managing, and monitoring an **Amazon EC2 instance**. For anyone who doesn't know, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is one of the foundational services in AWS—it basically provides **resizable compute capacity in the cloud**. Think of it as renting virtual servers that you can spin up or down whenever you need them.

## So, What Exactly is Amazon EC2?

Amazon EC2 is designed to make cloud computing way easier for developers like me. Here's why I think it's pretty cool:

* **It's Super Easy to Use:** The web interface is straightforward, so getting started and configuring capacity doesn't feel overwhelming at all.
* **I'm in Control:** I have complete control over my computing resources. I can run them on Amazon's proven infrastructure, which gives me peace of mind.
* **Speed and Flexibility:** I can get new server instances up and running in just minutes. This means I can quickly **scale capacity up or down** depending on what I need at any given time.
* **Pay for What You Use:** This is huge—Amazon EC2 changed the game by letting me **pay only for the capacity I actually use**. No more paying for idle servers!
* **Built for Resilience:** It gives me the tools I need to build **failure-resistant applications** and protect myself from common failure scenarios.

## What I Covered in This Lab

By the end of this lab, I successfully completed these core EC2 management tasks:

### Launch and Configuration
* I launched a web server with **termination protection enabled** (so I don't accidentally delete it)
* I modified the **security group** for my web server to **allow HTTP access** on Port 80

### Management and Scaling
* I **monitored** my EC2 instance's health and performance metrics to see how it was doing
* I **resized** my Amazon EC2 instance to scale its compute capacity (this is what they call Vertical Scaling)

### Protection and Cleanup
* I tested **termination protection** to make sure the safeguard against accidental deletion was actually working
* I **terminated** my EC2 instance once I finished all my testing

## Challenges I Faced

### Time Pressure
**What Happened:** Honestly, I didn't face too many technical challenges with this lab—it was pretty straightforward. The main thing working against me was time. I wanted to really explore and understand everything, but I had to keep moving to get through all the tasks.

**The Impact:** I felt a bit rushed at times, which meant I couldn't dig as deep into some concepts as I would've liked. But I still managed to complete everything successfully.
