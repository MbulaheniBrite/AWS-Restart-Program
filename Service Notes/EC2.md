# ☁️ AWS EC2 Instance Management Lab Overview

This lab provides a basic overview of launching, resizing, managing, and monitoring an **Amazon EC2 instance**. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a foundational web service that delivers **resizable compute capacity in the cloud**.

## 💡 What is Amazon EC2?

Amazon EC2 is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

* **Ease of Use:** Its simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction.
* **Complete Control:** It provides you with complete control of your computing resources, letting you run on Amazon's proven computing environment.
* **Agility & Speed:** It reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly **scale capacity, both up and down**, as computing requirements change.
* **Economic Model:** Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to **pay only for capacity that you actually use**.
* **Resilience:** It provides developers the tools to build **failure resilient applications** and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

## 🎯 Topics Covered and Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you were able to successfully perform the following core EC2 management tasks:

### 🚀 Launch and Configuration

* Launch a web server with **termination protection enabled**.
* Modify the **security group** that your web server is using to **allow HTTP access** (Port 80).

### 📊 Management and Scaling

* **Monitor** Your EC2 instance's health and performance metrics.
* **Resize** your Amazon EC2 instance to scale its compute capacity (Vertical Scaling).

### 🛑 Protection and Cleanup

* Test **termination protection** to ensure the safeguard against accidental deletion is active.
* **Terminate** your EC2 instance once testing is complete.
